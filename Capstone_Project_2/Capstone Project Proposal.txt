CAPSTONE PROJECT 2:
A COMPUTER VISION MODEL WHICH DETECTS BONE FRACTURES
IN THE UPPER EXTREMITIES NAMELY: 
WRISTS, FOREARMS, UPPER ARM, & SHOULDER FRACTURES

● PROBLEM STATEMENT FORMATION: 
Build an AI by the end of the week that detects bone 
fractures in X-rays images at at least 85% accuracy
to aid medical personnel in diagnosing fractures
in the upper extremities and thus expediting treatment.

● CONTEXT:
The Human body is a deeply complex organism, so much so
that people have dedicated their lives to understanding
it.  X-ray machines are a wonderful device which has 
greatly increased our insight into the human body,
particularly that of our bones.  With that being said,
interpreting the images can be difficult for novice and
trainee medical staff, especially when fractures in the 
bones are very small.  The aim of this project is to aid 
in fracture classification so as to expedite treatment 
of fractures in the wrist, arm and shoulder.

● CRITERIA FOR SUCCESS:
Successfully achieving 85% or better classification
accuracy when testing the model against new data,
with 85% percent being defined as 85% of X-rays
examined by the model were correctly classified as
True Postive, or True Negative.

● SCOPE OF SOLUTION SPACE:
This project will specifically focus on X-ray images of 
bone fractures in the wrist, arm (upper and lower), and
shoulder.  Due to the specificity of our data, great care
will need to be taken to avoid over-fitting the model data.

● CONSTRAINTS:
We have an annotated data set which makes supervised modeling
viable in this space, whether that is the best model for
our objectives it will need to be tested.  The biggest conern
we have is for over-fitting data.  I would've liked to have a 
more generalized set addressing fractures in other parts of
the human organism.

● STAKEHOLDERS:
A short list of Stakeholders would be:
Doctors
Physicians Assistants
Nurses
Nurse Practitioners
Medical Students
Learning Hospitals
Hospital Directors
etc.

● DATA SOURCES:
This is a proof of concept project with potential expansion
into production and hopefully general adoptation.  We will 
use the data set supplied by kaggle.com found at this link:

however during the course of the project other data may be
included and will be added below:
